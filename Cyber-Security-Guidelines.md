**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**

Currently, I practice some of the basic cyber security behaviours in my everyday activity. I use passwords to protect my laptop and mobile devices, I make sure that when I am not at my workstation, I lock my screen and I am very careful about opening my email or clicking on a link, especially when it is sent by a person or an organization that I do not know. I also have my operating system and applications updated because I know that updates usually deal with known security vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, I realise that I should improve in few areas like I will be more effective at using unique and strong passwords in each account rather than similar alternatives. I can also do a better job by allowing two-factor authentication to all platforms and being more active in examining account activity and settings instead of responding after an account problem has occurred.

**How can you make  secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**

To implement secure behaviour as a routine, I should incorporate security-aware behaviours in my everyday work routine to ensure that they become automatic. Easy habits like locking my screen each time I get out of my desk, even on a temporary basis can help a lot in minimising the chances of unauthorised access. I should also form the habit of taking a moment before clicking links or attaching files and questioning myself whether the source is trustworthy and whether I need to do it. System reminders, automatic screen lockups and the password management can also help facilitate this habit formation. In the long run, the constant use of these small steps will see security become an integral aspect of my life and not something I only think about once a possible threat is discovered.

**What steps will you take to ensure your  passwords and accounts are secure?**

To enhance the security of my accounts and passwords, I will employ a password manager to create and save strong unique passwords in each account. This will make it less likely to use the same passwords and the necessity to handle multiple credentials will be less challenging, without compromising security. I will also ensure that two-factor authentication is enabled on all accounts that use it, particularly those pertaining to work systems, email, and cloud-based systems. I will also make sure that I log out and leave the accounts on the common or public computers and in no case share the login information. Moreover, I will routinely check the activity on my account and security settings to trace any suspicious pattern of access or possible vulnerabilities.

**What would you do if you suspected a  security breach  or suspicious activity on your account?**

In case I suspect a security breach or I noticed any suspicious activity on my account, I would take immediate action in order to reduce the possible harm to a minimum. This would involve changing my passwords, disabling all running sessions, and turning on other types of security (like two-factor authentication) in case it was not already turned on. I would then forward the case immediately to my supervisor or any other IT or security contact at Focus Bear in order to investigate the problem. I would take all instructions given and support in any subsequent measures applying that early reporting is essential to prevent additional illegal actions or loss of information.

**Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.**

A new cyber security practice that I will have in place upon joining Focus Bear is undertaking a periodic review of my account security settings and my recent account logins on a regular basis say after every month or so. This routine will assist me to be proactive in the process of identifying suspicious behaviour at an early stage and keep the security features like two factor authentication up to date and always be aware of the threat of cyber security attacks. Through regular check-ups on my security preferences, I will be in a proactive measure to ensure that both organisational and user information is kept safe.
