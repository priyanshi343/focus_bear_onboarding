1. **What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?**

Agile provides many outstanding advantages for teams and companies. One of the major advantages of Agile is its ability to provide flexibility to teams, allowing them to react quickly to changing customer feedback or priorities. Continuous iteration will enable products to advance so quickly that you reduce the chances of spending months on a product that is not going to work for your customer’s needs. In addition, through frequent stand-ups, daily review meetings, and retrospectives, Agile offers a mechanism for improving teamwork, collaboration, and communication, ensuring all members are aware of all changes happening within their team.Additionally, one of the most prominent features of Agile is that it allows teams to deliver results faster. Because work is broken into smaller, incremental pieces, it permits the team to provide value to their stakeholders sooner. Continual learning is another key benefit provided by Agile. As a team, you will be consistently encouraged to reflect on what worked, what did not work and then take action to improve upon the previous experience.

While Agile has numerous strengths, it also presents numerous challenges. One of the primary challenges associated with the Agile methodology is the need for a disciplined team and effective communication. Without a continual process of updating one another and coordinating efforts, teams can become out of sync. Additionally, the uncertainty or ambiguity of Agile can be disconcerting, especially for individuals who are accustomed to detailed long-term planning or fixed timelines. The capability of Agile to accept change and incorporate it provides additional challenges with respect to altering priorities or starting projects with incomplete requirements. Lastly, managing stakeholder expectations can be a struggle with Agile, as predictable timeframes or fixed scopes are not always available under this project management methodology. Furthermore, a team’s ability to successfully use the Agile methodology is heavily based upon their level of experience; if team members are inexperienced, unwilling to communicate, or resistant to providing continual feedback, the use of Agile will likely result in failure.

**2. How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?**

Utilising Agile principles can help me to improve my productivity in the area of influencer partnerships and the digital marketing space, while also allowing me to be more organised, adaptable, and focused on continuously improving myself through iteration and flexibility. As my responsibilities include researching creators, reaching out to creators, coordinating content submissions, and tracking performance results, the focus on agility lends itself to the unpredictable nature of this work. Much like the tasks of creator responses, content timelines, and campaign performance, I can easily adapt my weekly prioritisation of tasks without losing momentum.
Due to the emphasis of the Agile methodology on breaking tasks down into smaller, manageable chunks, I can effectively avoid burnout and maximise my productivity by Productively Breaking Down Responsibilities into Micro-tasks, and track my progress through those chunks over time. By utilising a specific weekly sprint structure, (i.e., Outreach Targets, Routine Check-Ins, and Incremental Content Review) I'll be able to track my progress and achieve results by utilising regular check-ins and reflections similar to Agile’s Retrospective processes to determine what is working (e.g. effective outreach messages, successful partnerships).
In addition, due to the emphasis on clear and open lines of communication throughout the Agile methodology, I can maintain a high level of clarity with my supervisors and other team members as it relates to my work and their work and as a result better maintain a consistent direction with the overall direction of the campaigns I work on, particularly when I am working across multiple platforms to co-ordinate the work of many different creators in an effective and timely manner.
Agile's principle of Continuous Learning has been integral in furthering my focus on Building Skills in Neuro Diversity Informed Communication, Digital Health Marketing & UGC Strategy. Having multiple iterations will allow me to learn from the experience of Testing a Strategy, to be able to reflect upon what worked and what didn't and to make adjustments to improve on what I learned Next Week. The/Core Agile Principles will keep me organised, responsive and focused on developing in an Ever Changing, High Paced Role.

**3. Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.**

While both Scrum and Kanban are Agile frameworks for managing projects, they are quite different with respect to how work is structured and tracked during a project.

Scrum is based on an iterative set of time periods, referred to as 'sprints' (typically lasting 1-4 weeks). Prior to the start of a sprint, the Scrum team makes a commitment to a certain amount of work that will be completed during that sprint. The work that is committed to in a sprint cannot change until the end of that sprint. Scrum also provides for certain roles (e.g. Product Owner, Scrum Master) as well as ceremonies that occur throughout the lifecycle of a project (e.g. Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, Retrospective Meetings). Additionally, Scrum places a lot of emphasis on having a predictable cycle, planning the work of the team, and committing to the goals established at the beginning of the Sprint.

In contrast to Scrum's fixed cycle structure, Kanban is a continuous, flowing system where new tasks can be added to the board at any time. Kanban has no defined roles and no fixed timeframes. Instead, work flows through various stages on the Kanban Board until the work item is complete. Therefore, the primary goal of Kanban is to limit the amount of work in progress so that the team can operate at its maximum capacity without becoming overloaded and provide a consistent flow of completed tasks. Consequently, Kanban provides for a much more real-time and adaptable workflow process than the Scrum methodology.

**4. Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.**

"Responding to change over following a plan" is the Agile principle that will be most helpful in my work.

Things can change quickly in influencer partnerships and digital marketing: content may need to be revised, creators may respond slowly, campaign priorities may change due to performance data, or new opportunities may arise out of the blue. Being able to modify my tasks on a weekly basis rather than rigidly adhering to a plan will help me stay productive and in line with campaign objectives.

This idea enables me to:
- Modify outreach tactics in light of what is truly effective.
- When the timelines of the creators change, reorder the tasks.
- Remain adaptable during periods of high workload or academic demand.
- Treating change as normal rather than disruptive can help reduce stress.

I can remain consistent, stay goal-oriented, and produce better work even when things change by adopting this Agile mindset.
