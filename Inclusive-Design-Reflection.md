**1. How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?**

Communication requires deliberate and flexible adjustments in order to establish a neuro-differentiable environment (e.g., people with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, or other cognitive disabilities). Such changes not only favor neurodivergent people but tend to benefit the group as a whole by making things less ambiguous and more clear. We can use these ways to make communication style more inclusive : 
1.  Keep it straight and simple rather than making it complex :  Instead of ambiguous, figurative, or context-dependent communication we can use direct, literal, and explicit communication. This includes coming with straight forward agendas of meetings, stating the exact purpose of activities, and providing clear, practical feedback. Such things will reduce the cognitive burden of reading unwritten rules or social hints and provides a more predictable and available setting to people who might perceive information in different ways.
Example : 
Ambiguous: “We’ll figure it out during the meeting.”  
Inclusive: “Tomorrow’s meeting will cover: (1) routine design, (2) major tasks and (3) next steps."

2. Provide Multiple Channels of Engagement and Processing :  There is no single “correct” way to communicate or contribute. We should encourage multimodal interaction by verbal discussions with written summaries, allowing contributions through both spoken and written formats and sharing materials in advance. This flexibility accommodates diverse processing speeds, sensory needs, and expressive styles, ensuring everyone can participate in the way that suits them best.
Examples : 
- After a meeting, share a written summary with key points and action items.
- Send documents before the meeting, giving people time to process information at their own pace.
    
3. Create an Environment of Psychological Safety and Open Communication Needs :  We can make sure to create an atmosphere in which people are not afraid to express their communication preferences. Privately and proactively request, “How do you want information to be shared with you?” or “What can I do to make our meetings more fruitful for you?” This shift from assumptions to inviting dialogue will show respect, develops trust, and enables personal, effective accommodations that benefit the whole team.

**2. What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?**

In the case of an application such as Focus Bear, which is created to help people focus and be well, it cannot be optional to make it accessible. Because neurodivergent individuals are one of the target audiences, the typical pitfalls in UX can literally lock them out and some of the pitfalls are : 

1. Prescriptive workflows are inflexible : Simply making the app based on a single workflow that must be adhered to by all users, such as a compulsory session of meditation before anything is done, is based on a neurotypical idea of sequential functionality. This may be harmful because it dismisses neurodivergent challenges, such as when an ADHD user has the capacity to start a task, maintain attention, or control their emotions, since their capability may change on a daily basis. A strict order cannot necessarily be followed on a high-dysfunction day, and user failure will occur instantly. It also suggests that the system knows more than the user, thus making users feel underestimated and imposing pressure rather than assistance. Not only this, a user with autistic burnout or ADHD paralysis may need to begin with a low-demand win (such as clearing a small task) to gain momentum. The fact that they will not have a chance to do so because of a required meditation screen may cause them to drop the app altogether, strengthening their belief in their incompetence.

Alternative Inclusive Design: Follow a modular, toolkit approach. Introduce all functions (focus timer, break planner, habit tracker, distraction blocker, brain-dump space) as possible starting points. Install a “Start Where You Are” dashboard, where users can select where they are and create their own sequences. This respects the inherent power of the user over their own brain and encourages sustainable interaction by meeting them at the level they are currently able to manage.

2. Language and feedback: The language used around concentrating and staying productive often frames these issues as a matter of willpower, and the introduction of feedback mechanisms that humiliate people who do not follow the app’s rules can be harmful. Examples include terms such as “Failed Session,” “You Got Distracted!” pop-ups, “Broken Streak,” or inspirational quotes encouraging users to “Just Push Through!”. This affects users negatively because such language is essentially ableist. It gives neurodivergent characteristics (distractibility, difficulty initiating tasks) a moral meaning or labels them as laziness. For an ADHD user, being told they are “distracted” when their attention naturally shifted is comparable to being shamed for an unwanted neurological condition. The objective of the application is to be supportive. Judgment-based feedback transforms it into a source of anxiety and negative self-talk. Fear of “failing” the app may become the reason users avoid opening it. When a user ends a focus timer because of sensory overload or an urgent need to move, receiving a message such as “Session Incomplete: Try Harder Next Time!” invalidates their bodily cues, increases shame, and reduces the likelihood of using the timer in the future, as it becomes associated with punishment.

Alternative Inclusive Design: Use neutral, descriptive, and strength-based language. Replace “Failed Session” with “Session ended.” Replace “You got distracted!” with a non-interruptive log: “Pause detected.” Reframe streaks as consistency metrics, e.g., “You have used the app 8 times in the last 10 days,” rather than “You have broken your 7-day streak!” This fosters psychological safety and allows users to experiment and learn without judgment.

3. Visual and auditory overload at the interface: A notification system and dashboard that show excessive amounts of information, numerous choices, and too much visual stimulus at once can be overwhelming. This may appear as a home screen filled with multiple progress wheels, habit streaks, to-do lists, motivational quotes, and animated graphics; or as a spam of non-customizable notifications with loud sounds and flashing badges.An application that aims to help users focus should not itself become a source of distraction. Visual clutter and unpredictable auditory notifications may lead to sensory overload, stress, or shutdown for autistic users or individuals with anxiety disorders. This makes the app physically uncomfortable to use. Offering a large number of unprioritized choices (e.g., 10 types of focus timers on a single screen) can also cause decision paralysis, especially for people with executive functioning difficulties. The struggle to choose becomes a barrier to initiating tasks.

Inclusive Design Alternative:
-   Zen Mode Default: Provides an optional minimal screen with only the one or two core items the user wants (e.g., just a timer and next-task field).
 -   Granular Controls: Give the user control over sensory features: enable/disable animations, select notification sounds (or silent vibrations), adjust color contrast, and manage the amount of information displayed.

**3. What is one **practical change** you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?**

A feasible modification I can implement in my practice is to adopt a more accessible and understandable communication throughout any documentation, messages, and other materials that are accessed by users. This involves plain language writing, eliminating superfluous jargon, subdivision of information into bite size pieces and briefing or giving outlines where necessary. To vulnerable users, like neurodivergent people, less digitally literate people, or users with cognitive overload, effective communication lowers barriers, confusion, and enables them to interact with the content more independently.

Even in this internship, the small steps of using different resources for completing onboarding is helping me to process the information and understand it in a better and explained way.
