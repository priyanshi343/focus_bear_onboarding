**What is  your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?**

My role is that of Partnership Marketing Intern and I am part of the process of Agile since I will help in the delivery of value continuously, feedback loops, and cross-functional working. My work, which includes research to find potential partners, create outreach, and analyse the engagement data as well as input partnership proposals, are directly based on the product and marketing backlog.
My activity in a Agile environment helps advance the incremental progress through the division of the larger partnership initiatives into smaller and actionable tasks that may be prioritised and assessed and optimised, depending on the feedback. I also apply Agile values like adaptability and customer focus, as I will provide information about the outside world, partners and users to enable the team to change their priorities and make better decisions. I have made possible to learn and improve because I present the work in small bits that can be used in learning.


**How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?**

My roles are overlapping and interconnected with a number of important roles in the Agile team:

-   Product Manager (PM): I'll collaborate with the PM to provide information on partnership research and external stakeholders to make product priorities and strategic decisions. This partnership will make sure that the partnership programs are in line with the product vision and business objectives.
    
-   QA (Quality Assurance): I also have contact with QA as a channel through which I can receive feedback on usability, functionality, or bugs by partners or the end-user. This feedback aids QA in prioritising testing areas which impact the partner-facing features or workflows.
    
-   Agile Project Manager / Scrum Master: I liaise with the Agile PM to have my activities scoped, prioritised and followed up appropriately in the Agile process. This interrelation allows keeping transparency, dependencies, and blockers under control.
    
-   UX Designers and Customer Support: Since partner-facing material or experience must be user-friendly, it overlaps my work with UX. I also work in collaboration with customer support teams on the feedback about the partners and frequent questions, which leads to the continuous improvement.
    
In sum, my position functions as an interface between the external stakeholders and the internal team of Agile-oriented people that facilitates cooperation, openness, and accountability. This interaction adds value to Agile values in the sense that work is kept customer-centric, flexible and goal-oriented towards the organisational objectives.
  
**Write a short description of how your  role fits into the Agile team.**


My job as a Partnership Marketing Intern is relevant to the Agile team, because it facilitates the constant delivery of value by conducting research, working together, and providing feedback. I play a part in Agile process by dividing the partnership and marketing initiatives into smaller and manageable tasks that can be prioritised in the backlog and refined with assistance of feedbacks. My contribution assists in linking the external parties as well as user feedback with internal teams to make sure that choices are customer-oriented and flexible. My contribution to the principles of Agile, including collaboration, transparency and continuous improvement, is the exchange of knowledge and the delivery of work in small parts.

**Identify one  other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.**

One role I frequently work with is the Product Manager (PM) quite often. In order to enhance collaboration I will be able to make more precise and organized reports about partnership research and stakeholder insights so that the information is actionable and is in line with product priorities. My ability to enhance collaboration could also be by consulting previous feedback on idea, upfront clarification of expectations, and frequent communication. This will aid towards reduction of rework, enhancement of alignment and to be certain that the partnership initiatives are playing a role that is effective towards overall product and business objectives.
