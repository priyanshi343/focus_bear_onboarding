Focus bear was created to solve a problem which people face in their daily lives but never knew how they would solve it. It is majorly for people suffering from ADHD and autism but it actually is made literally for everyone as nowadays, we have smartphones and social media which is not only used by people suffering from ADHD or autism but literally everyone be it young generation or old age people mid aged people. Most people use social media and its an addiction when you start using it you don’t know how your time passes. It passes so fast. Focus bear is made to help us to maintain our routines give us alerts that our break is over and block the apps which are distracting so that we can focus on our work in a better way.

2. **What problem is Focus Bear solving?**
Focus Bear is providing a solution for individuals who are having problems with everyday life. The vast amount of distractions, both potential and actual, caused by smartphones, computers, online content, and social media, has made it very difficult for many different age groups to continue being focused, completing daily goals and developing good habits. In the past, males with ADHD, and the less-than-perfect females have been the only group who have faced many of these problems. However, today the overwhelming majority of the population experiences a number of issues associated with these aforementioned challenges.

3.  **Why Do You Think This Mission Is Important?**

Focus Bear's mission is important because it solves a challenge which people face in their everyday lives i.e. staying focused and following healthy habits and routines which is very difficult to follow in a world full of digital presence. 

1. It allows you to regain your attention :  As phones and applications compete with each other every second for people's limited attention, it is nearly impossible for an individual to effectively bear down on one task at a time for an extended period of time and create consistency. The Focus Bear initiative is critical to helping individuals take back control of their attention so that they can produce effectively and support their overall mental health and wellness.

2.  It creates an overall strategy for maintaining one's focus :  Focus Bear helps an individual to establish structured goals, schedules, and methods of maintaining focus, as well as to track the progress they are making towards their established goals. It recognizes that maintaining one's concentration is more than just having self-discipline and requires a specific structure to help achieve that goal. 

3. It enhances mental health and provides ways to practice technology wellness : As a result of Focus Bear's efforts to eliminate the feelings of being overwhelmed, establish a very structured schedule for taking breaks from employment, and establishing a clear boundary between working and not working, Focus Bear provides individuals with the ability to create and maintain a more sustainable work habit, as well as reduce overall levels of stress.

4.  **How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?**

Focus  Bear  is  in  alignment with my  values  and  interests because I believe in having discipline  in  my daily routine, setting goals to remain productive, and  maintaining  focus  on my life without  distractions.  In  addition  to  having  discipline, Focus Bear promotes  productivity,  self-improvement  and  a  healthy  balance  in  one's  personal  life  - all  things  I  am  passionate  about.   Being disciplined is not enough as  I know  that  social  media,  notifications  and  trying  to  multitask  can  easily  distract  someone.  That's  why I relate  to Focus Bear as they  have  developed  a service that  assists people in  establishing and adhering  to  a  daily  routine, improving their focus, and developing  healthier habits. Similarly,  I  use similar  techniques  for  improving  organisation  and  efficiency in my  own  personal life. I also believe  that technology should  enhance  the  quality  of  the  user's  life, not provide  another  means of distraction from  daily  tasks,  and Focus Bear demonstrates a way of using technology for  human  benefit  through  a  human-centred  approach. 
Finally, the way how  Focus  Bear  has  created  products and services that assist  individuals  with  ADHD  and  other  attention-related  disabilities  to  live  more  successfully really interests and fascinates me.

5.  **Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?**

Focus  Bear  addresses  a  number of challenges that  I  relate to, including  being  easily distracted by social media and notifications without realizing how much time has gone  by.  It can be challenging to keep dedicated to the many elements of my everyday routine, as balancing academic, occupational, and individual responsibilities often prevents me from being able to concentrate long enough to complete all of my tasks. Sometimes I make up my mind by telling myself to be productive and focus on building a routine but distractions interfere  with  my  ability  to  do  so.  Therefore, the options of guided focus sessions, disabling  potentially  disruptive  apps, and notifications/reminders is  something  that  truly resonates  deeply with me.  So yes, I do face few challenges and that  is exactly what  makes  me  value Focus Bear,  because  it is trying to  help solve  these  issues  for  those  of  us  who  face  them.
