**1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?**

Yes, I have undergone good group working and professionalism especially when under time pressure working with a small team. Teamwork was also effective due to effective communication, respect and common responsibility. Right at the start roles and responsibilities were not ambiguous and this minimized confusion and misunderstanding as each member knew what he or she was to contribute in the achievement of the team objectives.
The members of the team shared frequent and open updates on progress and difficulties. Whenever problems occurred, they were handled in time and in a constructive manner instead of being swept under the carpet or by blaming people. The feedback was provided in a respectful manner and it was aimed at helping to improve the quality of work which made the learning environment and the environment where people work safe.
The other major consideration was being professional in fulfilling promises. Team members were trustworthy and punctual in meetings and followed to the agreed tasks. In cases where a person failed to meet a deadline, he/she informed the team members early enough and collaborated to reach out to a solution.
In general, the respectful communication, accountability, and trust made a team very effective and led to high outcomes and the positive working experience.

**2. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?**

To make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive, I use a deliberate and thoughtful approach in the manner I engage with other people, both academically and professionally. My goal would be to speak straightforwardly, using plain and organized language, highlighting main points in the initial stages of the conversation, and to make sure that what is told is understood with the help of summaries or follow-up messages. This will minimize misunderstandings, particularly in remote work or team-based work.
I can ensure that my tone is always respectful no matter how informal the workplace might be. I am also conscious of the fact that it is easy to misinterpret written communication especially in a remote team and I will not use abrupt language, sarcasm, or assumptions. I also apply the active listening by giving others the room to express their views and agree with others, putting into consideration their input and not in reaction.
My communication style is based on inclusivity. I am aware of cultural diversity, different tastes in communication and levels of confidence in a group. I will also strive to speak in an inclusive manner, be willing to get the others to speak, and listen to opposing opinions. In case of agreement conflicts, I do not pay attention to the person but the task and strive to reconcile the problems by means of a polite conversation.
All in all, I aim at establishing an effective and inclusive communication environment where collaboration and mutual respect can be supported by being deliberate, empathetic, and encouraging feedback.

**3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?**
I would be able to contribute to establishing a positive, fun, and professional work environment by balancing the approachability and responsibility in my everyday interactions. I also hope to contribute a positive attitude in the workplace by being friendly, supportive, respectful to the colleagues, and at the same time take my duties seriously. The little things like welcoming team members, applauding their effort and giving them a hand when in need all help in creating a more friendly and inspiring environment.
I also bring a professional environment through being accountable and trustworthy. Being at the meetings on time, meeting the deadlines and reporting clearly on my progress helps to foster trust among the team.  I apply the right humour, cheer up on team triumphs and team-building activities without overstepping boundaries or being insensitive of inclusivity. I would take caution to make sure that humour or casual behaviour does not keep others out or uncomfortable.
In general, respect, positivity, and accountability can assist me to build a workplace environment where people and groups can be their best because of an enjoyable, supportive, and professional work environment.

**4.  How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?**
I am a good planner in preparing to meet supervisors and other staff members, as I always plan beforehand and ensure that I always attend. I go through the agenda, the documents before every meeting including the past discussions to familiarize myself with the situation and the aim. I write down critical points, issues or matters that I require to present and this assists me in participating in the meeting without any fear of forgetting or losing track.
I also take time to think about my progress and whatever difficulty I might be undergoing. During a meeting with the supervisor, I always strive to be very clear on what I have already done, what is being done, and where I might require some guidance or feedback. This helps to show accountability and make the meeting to be productive and not reactive.
Moreover, I also make sure I am well prepared logistically by making sure that the time and location of meeting are confirmed or using the online connection and be in time. In the case of virtual meetings, I ensure that I pre-check my technology to prevent inconveniences. Once the meeting has been ended, I ensure that I recap on major conclusions, activities and timelines to ensure that we are both on the same page.
On the whole, with proper preparation, effective communication, and time management, I can participate more actively in meetings and positively influence the professional relations and achievements.

**5. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?**
Being proactive in my internship would involve taking initiative even when my task is to be performed, and pursuing possibilities to contribute value to the organisation. Instead of waiting to be given instructions, I would attempt to know the overall objectives of the team, and then expected to help or offer in terms of what can be required. This involves putting in intelligent questions, offering to work on things when they are the right things to do and seeing ways to make things better.
Effective communication is also connected with proactivity. I would also share my progress with my supervisor on a regular basis, point out the possible problems early, and seek feedback on my work to keep it within expectations. In areas where I find that there are some gaps in a process or there is an area where I can play a role, then I would propose ideas in a polite manner and support them with an argument or with an example.
Also, being proactive entails taking the charge of my learning. I would also research independently, finding out about tools or systems or industry trends that are relevant to my role, implement such knowledge in my work, and think of the ways I can constantly develop. Being organised, reliable, and engaged, I will be able to demonstrate initiative, earn trust with my supervisor and workmates, and maximise my internship experience.

**6. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?**
To get an update or action from either a co-worker or manager, I will politely and respectfully check in on them, send them a simple and concise message that includes what I need from them, why I need it, and by when I need it done. I will be mindful  their other responsibilities, so I will not come across as making demands to them, and I will communicate with them in a professional and courteous manner. If it seems reasonable, I will inquire whether there is another time that works better for them or if they need additional information from me in order to pursue my request.
If I do not get a response after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed, I will follow up again using a different method of communication (for example, by sending them a brief message or mentioning it at a meeting). At this point, I will continue to assume that they had good intentions and focus on resolving this task, rather than expressing frustration toward them.
The only time I would escalate a lack of response is if that delay resulted in significant negative consequences, such as deadlines not being met, deliverables not being completed, or the team failing to meet. If this happens, I will escalate respectfully by sending a message to my direct supervisor that details the steps I took, the effects of the delay, and I will not assign blame to anyone; rather, I will try to find a solution. My approach is to maintain a proper balance between being persistent while being professional, holding people accountable while still being able to have and maintain a good working relationship with colleagues.

**7. What are some things you won't do?**
Throughout my internship experience, establishing clear and specific behaviours will support my commitment to professionalism while supporting the development of positive working relationships with my colleagues. I will avoid ignoring communications (messages, emails, requests for clarification) unless they influence my team’s ability to succeed and meet deadlines. If there is a time frame in which I cannot respond, I will provide a clear timeframe on when others can expect to hear from me. I will communicate this at the point of receipt, to avoid creating uncertainty for my colleagues.
Additionally, I will not use disrespectful language when referring to colleagues, supervisors, or companies in written or verbal forms. This means that I will make an effort to avoid using gossip, sarcasm, or negative types of comments that may hinder the development of trust and create a negative or uncomfortable atmosphere. I will also not dismiss the opinions or ideas of others, even if I disagree. I believe it is important to work collaboratively, with each member contributing to the process respectfully and inclusively.
Furthermore, I will take responsibility for any missed deadlines or meetings and will communicate any challenges that arise to prevent placing blame or allowing issues to escalate without notice. I will also avoid reacting defensively to constructive feedback and will remain open to learning and growing.
Ultimately, by identifying and establishing specific behaviours that I will avoid, my goal is to maintain a professional standard of conduct, foster a positive workplace culture, and develop strong and respectful working relationships during my internship.
