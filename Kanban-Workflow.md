**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**
Kanban assists to deal with priorities as everything is displayed on one board and the team can clearly see which tasks are the most important and those which are being done. Backlog tasks are prioritised in way that the more valuable work is tackled first. Since Kanban employs a pull system, the new tasks are only accepted when there is capacity available and not immediately. This does not allow overworking of people with numerous tasks at the same time.

Also the Work in Progress (WIP) limits of Kanban ensure that there is a limit to the amount of tasks to be worked on at a given time. This helps concentrate on the tasks already in progress before beginning others, minimize context switching and highlight the bottlenecks. Consequently, teams will be able to sustain an appropriate rate of work and consistently provide value.

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**

I would be able to enhance my workflow by visualising my work on a Kanban board and dividing bigger portions of work into smaller, easy manageable ones. My ability to concentrate on a number of tasks and the stress associated with multitasking will be minimized by working on fewer tasks simultaneously. I can also apply the Kanban to frequently check my workflow, detect blocked tasks at the earliest, and communicate my problems as well to other members of the team so that they can fix the problem fast.
The Kanban principle of using continuous improvement is another important principle. I can also change my way of doing things in order to make them more efficient and productive as time goes around because I will be able to think about the flow of tasks through the board and the places where delays can happen.

**Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.**

One way to improve task tracking in my position is updating the Kanban board in real time as I work on my tasks instead of updating it  retrospectively. This will enhance transparency, ease the ability of the team to view the current status, and allow the team to identify blockers at an early stage. Maintaining the board up to date is also more coordinated particularly when asynchronous or time zone work is to be performed.
