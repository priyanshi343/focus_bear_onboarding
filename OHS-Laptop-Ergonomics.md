**1. What  equipment changes  can you make to improve your workspace setup?**

In order to improve the ergonomics and comfort of my workspace, I would like to implement some of the major equipment additions. Among the key modifications is the utilization of a laptop stand to elevate my screen to eye level. This will assist in avoiding the strain on the neck and the shoulders caused by having to hunch forward. I also plan to include an external monitor that will have a bigger screen and will enable me to have a better head and eye posture throughout the day.
I will also start working with an external keyboard and a mouse, which will enable me to sit in a more comfortable position, positioning my arms and wrists, and reduce the benefits of having to spend a lot of time typing. 
I also will refurnish my desk system, arranging most frequently used objects nearby and maintaining my workspace clear so that it would provide more convenient posture and workflow. All these changes will contribute to a more favorable and effective working environment that will alleviate the level of physical and physiological discomfort, improve my productivity, and aid in establishing a more comfortable postural position.

**2. What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?**

To enhance my posture and alleviate physical stress when I use the laptop on a daily basis, I will implement several viable behavioural changes in my daily life. A regular break of movement, i.e., standing up, stretching, or taking a minute walk after every 30–40 minutes is one of the most essential habits. This will assist in avoiding stiffness and can enhance circulation as well as decreasing the amount of tension in my neck, shoulders and lower back.
The other useful change in behaviour to be made is the 20 20 20 eye rule; after every 20 minutes, I will stare at something 20 feet ahead of me at least 20 seconds. This will decrease eye strain and promote blinking that tends to subside when one focuses too long on a screen. I will also get used to alternating between sitting and standing to not allow myself to remain in the same posture throughout the length of the day.
Lastly, I will also include basic daily stretches in my neck, shoulders, wrists, and upper back to reverse the tension that forms due to extensive use of laptop. Through a continuous repetition of these change behaviours, I will be able to establish more healthy working habits that will enhance my posture, minimise discomfort, and increase overall well-being.

**3. How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?**

I will include reminders and tools that support my good posture and help minimize physical strain in my daily routine to facilitate them. Focus Bear is one of the most efficient methods that should be used to plan movement breaks. The application will remind me to stand, stretch, drink, or get my posture straight, after a set amount of time, so I would not be sitting too long without realizing it. Such subtle reminders will allow me to develop more healthy habits and avoid the stiffness and exhaustion caused by long periods of using a laptop.

Besides breaks, I will also have posture reminders in Focus Bear, as well as on my phone to remind myself to take a check-up every hour. The fact that I can use a speedy cue to remind me like, to relax my shoulders or to straighten my back helps me maintain my awareness and prompts me to make corrections to my posture, before pain sets in.

Another strategy I will employ will be to develop behavioural cues into my environment, such as having a sticky note on my laptop that reminds me to check my posture or have a water bottle around so that when I need to refill it I need to move regularly. Gradually, these easy stimuli will assist my body to learn how to correct itself.

The integration of technology-driven reminders using Focus Bear with minor environmental stimuli will enable me to design a consistent and friendly mechanism that will assist me in maintaining good posture, having regular breaks, and working in a healthier and more conscious manner.

4. **Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.**

A laptop stand is one of the gadgets that would greatly enhance my sitting position and comfort in general. Raising the laptop monitor to eye level to avoid a forward-head posture and lessen the pressure on the neck and shoulders. With an external keyboard and mouse, I'll be able to hold a more neutral position of the arm and the wrist thus working in a more comfortable and healthier position during the day.

**5. Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.**

A significant change I made towards making my ergonomic behaviors better was the introduction of scheduled movement breaks into my work schedule. I no longer sit and work long and continuous hours, instead I set time reminders to stand up, stretch and reposition myself after every 30-40 minutes. This change has assisted to decrease the amount of physical tension, enhance my attention and be more conscious of how I frequently fall into poor posture unintentionally. This is the easiest habit to incorporate and a habit that has helped in making the working environment more comfortable and healthy.
