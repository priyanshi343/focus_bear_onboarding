**What  steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?**

In order to keep the data highly secure in my daily operations, I will implement the principle of least privilege which implies that I will only access information that is highly relevant to my daily tasks. I will be careful in which platforms and systems used are approved by the organisations and not download or store sensitive information on personal devices. I will ensure I practice good digital hygiene by locking my screen when not in use, leaving the systems after use, and ensuring that my devices and applications are updated with the latest security patches. I will also exercise sensitivity on data and consent given by users that the data will be used only with the purpose in which it was given and approved.

**How should you  store, share, and dispose of sensitive information  safely?**

Only the encrypted, secure and organisation approved systems must be used to keep sensitive information so as to avoid unauthorised access. Personal laptops, external drives or unsecured cloud services should be avoided as a local storage. In cases where confidential information is involved, I will make sure that it is disseminated in need to know basis only to authorised parties via secure communication networks. Before transmitting data, I will ensure that the recipients and access permissions are confirmed, as well as file-sharing options. To dispose it, it is recommended to permanently delete the confidential information after the need to access it is met, making sure that it is removed out of the shared drives, backups, and the trash folders as per the organisational data retention and privacy policies.

**What are some  common mistakes  that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?**

The most common errors contributing to data privacy problems are sharing information with the wrong recipient, sharing information more frequently than needed, using personal devices or unprotected ones, bad password habits namely reusing passwords. Such errors could be prevented by checking the recipients of email addresses twice, sharing of permissions, access to data restricted to that needed to perform a task, accessing only to approved systems, and using strong and unique passwords with multi-factor authentication where feasible. The next common error is not reporting of suspected data incidences; this can be curbed by informing a supervisor or the person in charge of privacy immediately any issue of concern is identified.

**Identify at least  one habit or practice  you can adopt to improve data security in your role.**

Among the habits that I can acquire, I would like to pay attention to consciously pausing before accessing, sharing, or making changes to any data and evaluating the necessity, authorisation, and safety of the action. Asking myself whether I really need the data and whether I am dealing with it using the right tools, I will be able to decrease the chances of inadvertent abuse or leakage to a considerable extent. This practice will foster responsibility and will enhance a culture of data responsibility.

**Document at least one  key learning or security measure  you will implement.**

One of the major lessons is that of data minimisation. In the future, I will take an active role in ensuring that I only gather, access and maintain the least possible amount of data to be able to accomplish my assignments. The security measure is in compliance with privacy laws like GDPR and privacy principles of Focus Bear, and it can minimize risk without losing trust among users and other stakeholders.
