**When should you  use AI  for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?**
AI is advisable to assist with activities like brainstorming or generating first drafts of content, summarising information, or brainstorming on how to approach a problem in a different manner. AI can be applied in my job specifically to work more efficiently in research, write emails or clean up words.
Nonetheless, I need to use my personal abilities in the case of tasks, which demand critical thinking, judgement, creativity, or contextual knowledge, including the formation of strategic decisions, interpretation of stakeholder needs and the provision of  sensitive information. My personal analysis and knowledge should always define final decisions, professional opinions, and outputs instead of just using AI-generated suggestions.

**How can you  avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?**
To prevent becoming too dependent on AI, I will not take the outputs of AI as final, but as a draft or a starting point. I will be proactive in going through, revising and modifying AI recommendations based on my experience and expertise. Defining the limits of AI application, e.g. not using it to make decisions or engage in sensitive activities, is also a way to keep the balance.
I will also proceed to advance my personal skills by learning, responding, and practicing instead of replacing thinking with AI. In selective and deliberate use of AI, I will be able to use its efficiency and remain accountable and professionally competent.

**What steps will you take to  ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**
To guarantee the confidentiality of data, I will not input any confidential or personal information as well as sensitive data into AI tools. This comprises of user information, company records, company secrets, and their passwords. I will anonymise situations in requesting help and resorted to generic descriptions as opposed to actual data.
I will also adhere to organisational policies touching on use of AI and apply AI tools that are approved where necessary. Being conscious of the information that I post and checking the outputs can help me to be responsible in the use of AI and maintain organisational and user information.

**Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.**

One best practice I will exercise in harnessing AI tools at Focus Bear is not to input confidential, sensitive, and user identifiable information to any AI tool. In seeking help, I will anonymise all the situations and use broad descriptions as opposed to actual data. I will consider AI-generated outputs as a draft and always revise, amend, and authenticate the contents under my own consideration and approved references. This behavior will guarantee fair usage of AI and safeguard the privacy of users, the integrity of data, and maintain professional and ethical values of Focus Bear.
