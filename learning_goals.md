1.  **What do you hope to learn from this internship?**

This internship will allow me to learn more about neurodiversity, executive functioning, and behavioural design to be able to communicate better with ADHD and Autism users. I would also like to understand how vulnerable populations use digital tools and how communication and ethical design can be more inclusive to enhance the experience of vulnerable people with Focus Bear.

As an intern working in Influencer Partnerships and Creator Collaborations, I would like to develop an opportunity to do research on ADHD/ND creators, manage outreach,  coordinating content deliverables and analysis of performance by influencers. I will also like to be confident with end-to-end influencer marketing, UGC strategies, and digital health promotion.

Another aspect I would like to enhance in my practice is professional communication, flexibility, and collaboration skills, which I would expose myself to in the form of a weekly plan, frequent updates, and campaign tasks. On the whole, I would like to become a better and more professional in marketing and be able to make a difference in a mission-focused health tech startup.

2. **What skills are you most excited to develop?**

I am eager to get strong skill set for influencer marketing and creator partnerships, especially in the digital health and neurodiversity category. The outreach management, content coordination, and creator performance analysis will assist me in gaining confidence in end-to-end campaign and relationship management.

I also look forward to enhancing my knowledge base in neurodiversity and executive functioning as well as behavioural design because they are critical in creating accessible communication and serving vulnerable users. I am keen on developing the ability to create messages and content, which are neurodivergent-friendly and inclusive.

Moreover, I wish to become a more well-developed professional communicator, adaptable and a team-player. With well-planned weekly meetings, effective reporting, and frequent updates, I would expect to become more organised and effective in the fast-paced startup environment.

On the whole, I am eager to expand my marketing skills as well as my ability to develop meaningful inclusive experiences to users.

3.  **What do you think you can contribute to the team?**

I believe, I'll be bringing a good mix of communication, creativity, and a true desire to help neurodivergent users. My experience in marketing and content creation would help introduce new concepts to the influencer outreach, creator collaboration, and UGC campaign development. I believe that I can find the right ADHD-affirming and neurodiversity creators, create effective outreach communications, and establish supportive working relationships that will help to reach our planned partnership.

I'll also use my knowledge of neurodiversity, accessibility and behavioural design to approach communication and content in a user-centred way, where language, instructions and marketing information are inclusive and favourable to vulnerable groups.

Not only this, I will also use effective reporting, weekly structural planning and consistent communication, which will keep the team in track throughout the 60 days campaign. I am also flexible and eager to learn, which results in my ability to accept new tasks and assist the team in any case.

In general, I will be able to bring energy, attention to details, and an outlook-oriented mentality which is very much in tune with the objectives of Focus Bear.

4.  **What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?**

The one area that I am not as confident in and I would like to improve is my technical competence when working with such tools as GitHub, campaign management, and performance analytics. Even though I slowly get more and more confident in using repositories installation and playing with the terminal, I still need to gain greater proficiency when it comes to comprehending data formats, monitoring the work of influencers, and applying analytics to the data.

The development of such skills will assist me in being more independent, adding more value to influencer campaigns, and making data-driven decisions regarding creator partnerships. I am eager to learn and feel more comfortable with the technical and analytical side of the job throughout the internship.

5. **What does success in this internship look like for you?**

For me, succes in this internship is about developing both professionally and personally and making effective contribution to the mission of Focus Bear. Success to me appears as being able to gain trust in organizing influencer partnerships on the end-to-end level, which includes researching creators and  reaching out to them, organizing content and evaluating performance. I would consider that a significant success if I will be able to independently operate the elements of the 60-day campaign and observe tangible relations with creators and their viewers.

It also involves success in enhancing my knowledge about neurodiversity, executive functioning, and behavioural design and using it to design a more inclusive experience of communication and user experience. When I'll be able to regularly adjust my language, outreach and content to suit neurodivergent users more effectively, it would indicate actual skill growth.

Success means enhancing  professional communication, organisation, and adaptability, i.e. clear reporting, weekly planning, and successful teamwork. If at the end of the internship period I am more confident, more proficient and capable of adding value on my own, then I will realize that I have succeeded.
