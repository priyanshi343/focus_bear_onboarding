**How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?**

Agile ceremonies are very important to enhance communication and alignment through formulating regular and structured meeting of the team to provide updates, priorities and resolve issues early. Team is kept informed about progress and blockers through ceremonies like daily stand-ups and when there is a need to align the team on what work is most important at a given point in time, sprint planning or continuous prioritisation is used. Retrospectives promotes discussion and reflection, where the team can gain experience and work better together based on experiences in the past. In general, Agile ceremonies help to minimize misunderstandings, facilitate shared ownership, and make individual tasks aligned to the overall team and organisational objectives.

**Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?**

Backlog refinement and prioritisation is the most significant ceremony in my situation as a Partnership Marketing Intern. The reason is that my work can be characterized by many research, outreach, and preparative processes that should be well-scoped and aligned to product and business priorities. Refining backlog will help me to clear up expectations, learn the dependencies with other teams, and make sure that my work is relevant and actionable. It also enables a chance to implement feedback earlier and lessen rework and make my efforts favorable to reaching the overall Agile goals.

**Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.**

One change that I can make to enhance team work is to make more formal and proactive updates about what I am doing especially in case I am working asynchronously. I can become more transparent and easier to work with or build upon my work by recording progress, blockers, and insights in shared tools rather than  using verbal updates only. This change will lead to reducing miscommunication, contributing to the better alignment, and consolidating the teamwork in the Agile environment.
